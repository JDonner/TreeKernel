A C++ implementation of nlp tree kernels per Alessandro Moschitti's 2006
paper, "Making Tree Kernels Practical for Natural Language Learning"

This is incomplete as-is, it needs something called 'Tree' to parse from
the Penn Treebank form, eg:

(ROOT
  (S
    (NP (PRP$ My) (NN dog))
    (ADVP (RB also))
    (VP (VBZ likes)
      (S
        (VP (VBG eating)
          (NP (NN sausage)))))
    (. .)))

See http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/parser.
Ask for my tree parser if you really want it.

This is commercially useable. I have not yet integrated it with any
SVM software, libSVM is my top candidate. If you succeed, let me know
or better yet, offer your patches to libSVM.

There are several optimizations possible - templating out sigma,
making NodePairsDeltaTable an unordered_map, but most of all, storing
the Nodes in Sentence in a vector and using indices as pointers to
them (to save memory and cache). C bindings would be nice, too.

if you make any improvements I'll be happy to take them. Of course,
you can just do what you want with it, subject to the BSD license in
LICENSE.
